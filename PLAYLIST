------ So first a table is created listing the artist's information. Then a table is created listing the artist's song infomation. So here, the data 
that us shared is the artists name. 

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    artist TEXT,
    title TEXT);

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Taylor Swift", "Shake it off");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Rihanna", "Stay");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Celine Dion", "My heart will go on");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Celine Dion", "A new day has come");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Shania Twain", "Party for two");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Gloria Estefan", "Conga");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Led Zeppelin", "Stairway to heaven");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("ABBA", "Mamma mia");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Queen", "Bicycle Race");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Guns N' Roses", "Don't cry");

------ So, in order to select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists, I first have to created a query that lists all artists from the first
table that are in the pop genre. Then I use the IN operator to select the titles of the songs where the arist is listed on my previous quesried results. 

SELECT name 
FROM artists
WHERE genre="Pop";

SELECT title FROM Songs WHERE artist IN (SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre="Pop");
