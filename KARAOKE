------People get picky at the end of the night. Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', 
and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.


SELECT title FROM songs;
SELECT TITLE from songs WHERE mood ='epic' OR released >1990;
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood ='epic' AND released >1990 AND DURATION <240;
