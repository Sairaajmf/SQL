-------- In order to retrict data like below, I selected all the authors who wrote an aggegated amount of 1M words or more from their books
using the HAVING operator to pull the data from the totals instead on the individual entries in the table. (state the table (from) after listing the 
colums I want pulled). 

SELECT author, sum(words) 
AS total_words FROM books
GROUP BY author
HAVING total_words >1000000;

----- I pulled the same info but for the average word count being 150000. (DO NOT USE ,,, in numbers)

SELECT author, AVG(words)
AS avg_words FROM books
GROUP BY author
HAVING avg_words >150000;
